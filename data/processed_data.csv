Currently, I lead fundraising analytics at the DNC (Democratic National Committee). I joined in July 2020 to support the election cycle, resulting in a record-breaking $1bn raised, 81mm votes and a successful presidential campaign. Looking forward to now returning to my ambitions of founding a company!My experience is in the intersection of the creative and analytical, including fashion retail, media and now politics. I started my career as a buyer at Bloomingdale's, running my own $5mm business-within-a-business before the age of 25. From there, I joined a menswear subscription start-up Bombfell as the first buyer hire. I grew to manage the entire inventory department, the largest cost line of the business for a headcount of 10. I left to join New York Public Radio with 25mm+ monthly audience and $100mm in revenue as the head of audience insights. I left to start a company and raised a seed round before parting ways with my co-founder.In addition to insights on the industries above, happy to help with anything around analytics, especially around data storytelling and visualizations for non-technical folks. My analytics experience has focused on customers/ donors on both acquisition and retention. Also have extensive experience in operations from running an operationally-complex subscription service, from production to fulfillment. Finally, I'm passionate about people-management from hiring to running great teams so always happy to offer advice or just a listening ear!I have several ideas which range widely (likely reflective of my winding path!) most in the earliest stages of conception ranging from a low-code tool to enable data folks to deploy mini-apps/ light BI layer for non-technical stakeholders to circular economy subscription services (junk removal, compost) to home improvement for renters.

I have worked extensively with early-stage startups, twice joining as the first 10 employees to help the company validate, launch, get to market, and start to scale. I love building early-stage startups and find the chaotic nature of it to be fun and where I do my best work. I've also had experience in large corporates across industries including AI, fintech, and B2C. My latest venture was an app that helped students better organize their life and was backed by Canada's largest bank. Last September, I packed up my life in Canada and jumped on a 1-way flight to New Zealand to take a gap year and reorient my life. During this time, I've been volunteering my expertise with local businesses, exploring this beautiful country, and deeply reflecting on what I want next. A year later, I'm now ready to re-emerge and get back to solving meaningful problems around building up the ecosystem for non-traditional entrepreneurs.I'm open to starting a new venture, joining an existing venture, or playing a role in scaling your venture if we find mutual alignment.For me, it's always less about the idea, and more about the people and the problem we're trying to solve. I want to get back into the messiness of the startup world I love, with people I'm excited to work with and can learn from, and solve a meaningful problem that betters the world. My goal is not to raise money or to hit a certain valuation, but to focus on what matters: build a company with principles that creates a rippling and lasting change.I am looking for value-aligned co-founders beyond complementary skillsets. What that means to me is finding people who are idealist (believe in challenging existing norms) but is practical (understand where current boundaries are); people-first in building a tribe, not just a team; smart problem solvers who focus on the what as much as the how; and genuinely authentic kind humans. The best way to get to know a cofounder is to work on small projects together and expose each other to extreme situations in order to see how we react (eg. our chemistry) and how we solve the problem (eg. compatibility)."

There has never been an easier time for anyone anywhere to start a business. I’m super passionate about anything that will accelerate this trend. The ultimate goal is to create a global community of highly engaged small businesses (who do not necessarily fit the traditional venture mould).Examples of these are:
📖  Education & know how: Y Combinator (Paul Graham letters), First Round, On Deck etc.
👨🏾‍💻  Software/Technology/Tools: Shopify, Meesho, Square, Amazon, Udemy, Airbnb (essentially any product that makes it easy for anyone to earn a living) etc.
💰 Finance - Accelerators, Lending etc: Stripe Capital, Clearbanc, Shopify Capital, YC, Pioneer.app, Angellist, Kickstarter

As a member of the Senior Leadership Team, I orchestrated the company through an acquisition and a merger of our two largest competitors. Currently consulting at co:collective, a creative and strategic transformation partner for purpose-led businesses. Formerly VP of Education & Experience at Foursquare, Marketing Manager at H&M, Media Supervisor at Mediacom. But my first job was a smoothie maker and my second job was a cashier in the Men's Suits department at Nordstrom, that's where my client service roots began.About me: I'm an academic who loves studying group dynamics especially around team building and talent development. I have a natural curiosity about everything I do. My superpower is taking a holistic view and figuring out what problems need to be solved. Then I solve them.Work experience: I'm currently a full-time consultant at co:collective working with companies going through transformational changes and living out a higher purpose. (If you DM me and I don't respond for hours, it's because I have a very demanding day job.)I've worked in media planning at Mediacom across Warner Bros, H&M, Hasbro and 3M. I was recruited to the client-side as a marketing manager at H&M where I started their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, orchestrated a tween fashion flashmob and opened our first store in Mexico before putting David Beckham in his underwear in a Super Bowl commercial where we ""won the internet"" for most tweets (beating out Doritos). I spent the last 8 years building at Foursquare. I built their sales team, account management team, sales enablement department, new hire onboarding, employee education, DEI programs and overall company culture work. I was affectionately referred to as ""the knower of all things"".What I'm exploring/building:
A socially and locally-based story-sharing network that helps our friends and neighbors discover solutions for how to get back on their feet by connecting them with professionals in their own communities who have been there and done that and lived to tell the tale.An opportunity for mentors, advisors, coaches and hiring managers who want to give back to the communities that made them based on the stories that shaped them. A network to collectively discover the hidden talent that’s all around us at scale to give people a chance to be what they haven't seen, until now.I'm extremely passionate about this because I've never seen a Latinx woman in a C-level position in tech. I am the change I want to see.I've narrowed my idea a bit further to get to an MVP, It's a multi-media ResuMEME that shows or tells your 2-minute story.  This is a platform that allows you to build a multi-media resume to tell your quick story that goes way deeper than your LinkedIn ever dreamed it could. It’s the platform to “be seen”. A platform to get discovered for who you are the stories you've accumulated along your journey. It's a platform to discover others who have taken similar paths and get inspired that there's no ""right way"", only your way. It's a platform to find your people. Be the change you want to see. Or find the changers you’ve never seen."

Ran small non-profits ages ago, then small businesses in college.  Still think that college consulting is a lucrative space that too many people sleep on.
Worked at Facebook for two years as a software engineer.  Left January 8th after being a tech lead and running a small team of engineers.
Excited to start this new chapter, meet all of you, and help in any way that I can!Philip Ruffini and I are helping consumer brands radically change the way they engage with their customers.  We want to make it so that you can have a celebrity level partnership with every single customer.  We’re a long way from that vision, but we’re getting a bit closer every day!
You can check us out here: tryfluence.comAsks:
If you have any marketing experience, I would love to talk to you and learn!  I’m a engineer by study and practice, but I always want to learn more (especially now that I’m working in this space!)
If you have any experience working in consumer products, know anyone working at a consumer product company, or are running one yourself, I’d love to get in touch!  The more potential users we can talk to, the better product we can build!Offers:
If you’re looking to hire engineers, I have long lists of smart friends who I’ve been privileged to work with.  Always happy to introduce people!
I have some experience mentoring, interviewing, and leading engineering teams.  Always happy to talk about lessons learned, even though I’m not sure I’m the best resource for this in this community!
Worked on the Jobs Product at Facebook for two years, so I have pretty in-depth knowledge of Jobs Boards and that product space.  Would absolutely love to chat about it.
Spent 9 months doing deep research into ed-tech, so I’m also happy to share anything I know or make intros if you’re interested in that space!Fun Facts:
Took a year off in college to travel the world with the country’s first a cappella group!  Talk to me about music, performance, and anything artistic!
Almost double majored in history with a focus on religious intellectual history.  I’m a big theology nerd, and I’m happy to talk about faith wherever and whenever!
I try to read constantly (hit a personal goal of 52 books last year!) so if you have any good book recommendations, I would love to hear them!  Always trying to learn more, read more, watch more, etc.Connect With Me:

I started at Shopify Plus (enterprise division) as an early sales rep back in 2016, and left in 2017 to join an early-stage company called Clearbit as their 1st hire on the growth team. I left in 2018 to start building, and started a growth agency in early 2019. Since then, we've helped 25+ Seed-Series A tech companies build their marketing engines, including Charlie Health, Toolbox, and Upscribe.What I've Done — I'm an advocate of 'growth experiments', where you scope a campaign by time/budget and have a clear idea of what outcomes mean. I've run experiments in a variety of channels (email, SEM, paid social, etc.) and helped companies to validate where they should be spending time. This could be $2k/mo or $50k/mo.Current Interests — I'm trying to identify similarities between B2B SaaS companies and their growth challenges, i.e. lack of visibility into data, creating target lists, etc."
