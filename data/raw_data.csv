There's an embedded earned wage access system within the apps that enable workers (W2 & 1099) that enables funds to be available within hours of their shift being completed.

Think long and short haul truck driving, commercial construction, etc. I'm in the process of evaluating these markets from the bottom up (interviews) and more broadly (research, surveys, etc.). I'd like to create liquidity here.","A few elements I'm looking to include in the business is a consumption based approach (think Square's programmatic lending, Google Adwords, etc.) and leveraging the continual drop in cost for producing animated content.

I built their sales team, account management team, sales enablement department, new hire onboarding, employee education, DEI programs and overall company culture work. I was affectionately referred to as ""the knower of all things"".","What I'm exploring/building:
A socially and locally-based story-sharing network that helps our friends and neighbors discover solutions for how to get back on their feet by connecting them with professionals in their own communities who have been there and done that and lived to tell the tale.","An opportunity for mentors, advisors, coaches and hiring managers who want to give back to the communities that made them based on the stories that shaped them. A network to collectively discover the hidden talent that’s all around us at scale to give people a chance to be what they haven't seen, until now.",I'm extremely passionate about this because I've never seen a Latinx woman in a C-level position in tech. I am the change I want to see.,"I've narrowed my idea a bit further to get to an MVP, It's a multi-media ResuMEME that shows or tells your 2-minute story.  This is a platform that allows you to build a multi-media resume to tell your quick story that goes way deeper than your LinkedIn ever dreamed it could. It’s the platform to “be seen”. A platform to get discovered for who you are the stories you've accumulated along your journey. It's a platform to discover others who have taken similar paths and get inspired that there's no ""right way"", only your way. It's a platform to find your people. Be the change you want to see. Or find the changers you’ve never seen."

c) I worked on a variety of projects focusing on AR/VR/MR applications within the design process for engineers.
d) Finishing my time there I got the bug to start a startup while on a camping trip somewhere in Sweden with some friends. I came to the conclusion that a startup is the ultimate way to give back. 
e) Joined Entrepreneur First in London where my cofounder and I got pre seed funding to build something that helps mechanical design engineers communicate their designs.","What I'm Currently Working On
a) I’m the co-founder of Obi, which helps mechanical design engineers communicate their designs with clients through a web based platform.
b) We’re starting small and focusing on mechanical engineers at small firms or consultants that may work with non-technical clients.
c) I’m extremely excited about contributing to the digitisation of the physical world by getting rid of physical prototypes as much as we can through technology. 
d) Eventually we want to introduce augmented reality but first things first is to solve the issue with minimal tech (to save time).",,,,,
